for help with expanding the array dynamically because we placed the array on 
the heap vs the stack.

Creates a new dynamic tempArray which is the original size of the array plus
the arraySize. We have to be mindful not to allocate too much on the heap
to avoid eating up unsed memory. A for loop is utilized to 
iterate through myArray and assign it's elements to tempArray.

Top is also reset at it's initial -1 for myArray and incremented
based on the number of elements inserted. */
